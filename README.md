# Word Guess

Basic hangman game using vanilla JS, bootstrap, css, and html.

# Usage

A random word selected from a word bank will be selected.
Player has 9 tries per word. Each time the player guesses wrong, lives decrement by 1. Reaching 0 lives will result in restarting the game and incrementing losts. If the player guesses the word before lives is 0, then wins will increment and the game will restart. Each time the player guesses a letter, the current word with blanks will be updated. Guessed letters will be shown.
